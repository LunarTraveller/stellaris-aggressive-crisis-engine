[B]Aggressive Crisis Engine (ACEMOD)[/B] is a collaborative Stellaris mod with new crisis AI and a great amount of crisis improvements.

Vanilla AI is off for main crises and all fleet movements are mod scripted, this includes military fleets, constructors, army transports and swarm infestors.

Galactic empires receive initial massive damage penalty against crisis factions. New technologies are required to be obtained in order to mitigate this.

ACEMOD is flexible and modular. Users are able to switch individual components on and off at game start.

Modders can use ACEMOD AI for their own custom country_types and exclude individual fleets from ACEMOD AI for their own events. Current list of effects for modders to use is inside [b]acemod_fleet_events.txt[/b].

[i]Presented in the video above: 5 year comparison of Aggressive Crisis Engine vs 2.7.2 Vanilla crisis AI (Unbidden). At the end of an 8 minute test Vanilla crisis had 5 starbases and ACEMOD AI had 18.[/i]

- Full support for Contingency, Prethoryn Scourge, Unbidden, Aberrant and Vehement. Additional crises in works (Gray Goo, maybe Khan).
- New custom pathfinding accounting for wormholes and gateways. Begone loops.
- Aggressive not only in the name. Fleets are relentless and always seek targets.
- Crisis planet killers (WIP).
- Active territorial defense (WIP).
- Extended crisis options, including "fixed vanilla", hard mode and brutal setting. You will not survive (WIP).
- New technologies and quests to obtain them (WIP).
- Various fixes like changing crisis bombardment stance and making unarmed crisis ships flee when in danger.

[i]Overnight test run of ACEMOD AI crisis on Stellaris 2.7.2. Default settings but technology cost on x0.25. All empires were on repeatables. Crisis on x1 strength was squashed, this is a x5 Scourge.[/i]
